# VisualLookStyleAssistance
Global fashion industry is valued at three trillion dollar bill and accounts for 2% of world's GDP. We made a virtual fashion assistant that looks at customers Instagram and Facebook images and classifies what fashion category they are wearing either bags dresses and pants. My virtual assistant can help the retailer detect and forecast the fashion trends and launch targeted marketing campaigns.
